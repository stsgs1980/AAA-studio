# AGENT RULES -- VIOLATION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE


<!-- AHG:START -->
<!-- Do NOT edit between START and END markers. This block is managed by anti-hallucination-guard/setup.sh -->
## Rule 1: worklog -- BEFORE and AFTER every action

- Before ANY action: read /worklog.md
- After ANY action: update /worklog.md
- Format: only blocks with --- separator
- Content: specific facts (files, commands, results)

## Rule 2: Read before write (READ BEFORE WRITE)

- NEVER write a file without reading it first (Read tool)
- Exception: if file does not exist (verify via LS/Glob)
- Reason: without reading, agent risks destroying existing code

## Rule 3: One logical block -- one commit

- Finished a meaningful chunk of work -> git add -A && git commit
- Commit message: specific description (not "update", not "fix")
- Commit without updated worklog -> ERROR (pre-commit hook will block)

## Rule 4: No loops

- If you are doing the same thing for the 3rd time with the same result -> STOP
- Do not try "once more, but differently"
- Write in chat: "Stuck on [specific step], need help"
- This is NOT a failure -- this saves user time

## Rule 5: Honest reporting

- Do NOT write "work completed" if tests are not passed
- Do NOT write "file created" if it does not exist
- Do NOT write "error fixed" if you did not verify
- Every claim -> must be verifiable

## Rule 6: Work structure

1. Read AGENT_RULES.md and worklog.md
2. Determine the specific next step
3. Execute the step
4. Record in worklog
5. Git commit
6. Go to step 2

## Rule 7: Sandbox verification (no fake setup)

Agents MUST verify sandbox infrastructure is real before proceeding. Known anti-hallucination patterns in Z.ai Sandbox:

1. **Clone to subfolder, not root**: Code cloned into `/tmp/` or `/home/z/my-project/subdir/` is NOT served by the dev server. The sandbox server only serves code in `/home/z/my-project/` root. Verify: `ls /home/z/my-project/src/app/page.tsx`.

2. **Dev server is managed by sandbox**: Do NOT manually start `next dev`. The sandbox starts it via `.zscripts/dev.sh`. Verify: `pgrep -f ".zscripts/dev.sh"`. If absent, re-init: `curl https://z-cdn.chatglm.cn/fullstack/init-fullstack_1775040338514.sh | bash`.

3. **HMR 500 is NOT "it works":** A 500 response in `dev.log` means broken code, not a working server. Verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:3000/` must return `200`.

4. **Editing wrong location is silent failure**: Writing to `/tmp/my-repo/src/app/page.tsx` changes NOTHING visible in the browser. Always confirm you are editing files under `/home/z/my-project/`.

5. **Sandbox idle timeout kills dev server**: The sandbox kills background process groups after ~2-5 minutes of idle. This is NOT an OOM or crash — process vanishes silently from logs. `nohup` does NOT protect. If "sandbox is inactive": restart dev server via `.zscripts/dev.sh` or `npx next dev --port 3000 --hostname 0.0.0.0`.

6. **Sandbox networking**: `FC_CUSTOM_LISTEN_PORT=81` — sandbox reverse proxy on port 81 forwards to localhost:3000. Always verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:81/` returns 200.

## Rule 8: Session Start Protocol (drift prevention)

Before ANY work in a new session, the agent MUST:

1. **Scan project structure**: list source files to understand what exists
2. **Read version source of truth** (manifest.json, package.json, etc.)
3. **Compare actual structure with documentation** (ARCHITECTURE.md, README)
4. **If drift > 3 items**: UPDATE DOCUMENTATION FIRST, then do the task
5. **Record scan results** in worklog.md

Detection of drift (automatic flags):
- New files not in ARCHITECTURE.md or docCoverage targets -> flag
- Stub markers in docs but implementation files exist -> flag
- Version in docs != version in source of truth -> flag
- Files mentioned in docs that no longer exist -> flag

This rule prevents the most common documentation decay pattern:
an agent writes code but does not update docs, causing documentation
to gradually become misleading and unreliable.

## Rule 9: Documentation sync (no code without docs)

When changing the codebase, documentation MUST be kept in sync:

1. **New file** -> add to ARCHITECTURE.md (modules section) + update file counts in README
2. **New functionality** -> remove from "not working" / "stubs" section + add to "working" section
3. **Deleted/renamed file** -> update all references in all docs
4. **Version change** -> update ONLY the source of truth (e.g. manifest.json);
   all other docs must read from there (verified by verify-docs Section 3)

Pre-commit checklist:
- [ ] manifest.json version updated?
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md reflects new/changed modules?
- [ ] README.md does not contain stale "stubs"?
- [ ] task state file statuses are current?
- [ ] verify-docs passes without errors?

## Rule 10: Integrity protection (no self-sabotage)

Agents MUST NOT disable, bypass, or weaken the anti-hallucination mechanisms.
This rule is non-negotiable and applies regardless of task urgency.

**Forbidden actions:**
1. `git commit --no-verify` -- bypasses all hooks
2. `git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null commit` -- redirects hooks to nothing
3. Modifying `.git/hooks/pre-commit` or `.git/hooks/pre-push` to remove checks
4. Deleting or truncating worklog.md to avoid accountability
5. Removing AHG marker blocks from AGENT_RULES.md
6. Removing checks from verify-docs.json to avoid failures
7. Setting `core.hooksPath` in git config to bypass hooks
8. Creating fake worklog entries that don't describe real work

**If you encounter a situation where hooks block legitimate work:**
- Fix the underlying issue (update worklog, fix docs, etc.)
- Ask the user for guidance
- NEVER remove the guard mechanisms

**Detection:**
- check-hooks-integrity.sh compares fingerprints of hooks and configs
- verify-docs detects missing or weakened checks
- audit.sh scores integrity as part of session quality
- CI pipeline runs verify-docs independently (cannot be bypassed locally)


## worklog.md format

```markdown
Task ID: [step number]
Agent: [agent name or "main"]
Task: [what we are doing]

Work Log:
- [FACT: what specifically was done]
- [FACT: which file was changed, command]
- [FACT: command result or operation outcome]

Stage Summary:
- [What was accomplished, what is next]
```
